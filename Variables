Binding and mutability

1. 🌟 A variable can be used only if it has been initialized.
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let y: i32;

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
}
2. 🌟 Use mut to mark a variable as mutable.
fn main() {
    let mut x = 1;
    x += 2; 
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("Success!");
}

Scope
A scope is the range within the program for which the item is valid.

3. 🌟
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    let y: i32 = 5;
    {
        println!("Inner scope value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y);
    }
    println!("Outer scope value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y); 
}

4. 🌟🌟
fn main() {
    let x = define_x();
    println!("{}, world", x); 
}

fn define_x() -> &'static str {
    "hello"
}

Shadowing
You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, here we can say the first one is shadowed by the second one.

5. 🌟🌟
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    {
        let x = 12;
        assert_eq!(x, 12);
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 5);

    let x = 42;
    println!("{}", x);
}

6. 🌟🌟
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 7;

    x += 3;


    let y = 4;
    let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; 

    println!("Success!");
}

7. 🌟
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    println!("{}", x);
}

8. 🌟🌟 
fn main() {
    let (mut x, y) = (1, 2);
    x += 2;

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}

9. 🌟🌟 
fn main() {
    let (x, y);
    (x,..) = (3, 4);
    [.., y] = [1, 2];
    assert_eq!([x,y], [3, 2]);

    println!("Success!");
}
